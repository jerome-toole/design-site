    <p>I designed and built a Wordpress site for Brainchild festival. Creating an immediately engaging landing screen with video and optional sound.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the site was the line up which was designed in order that the user could flick through them without having to reload. They could also play YouTube or Soundcloud links from the artist without leaving the page.</p>

<p>Using simple colours and typography, the site has a fresh and lively feel.</p>
